  What is GamersHeaven?
---------------------------------------------

- GamersHeaven Is a project which aims to Find what drives [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/) User Review Sentiment the most.

- The Hypothesis is that Discounts are a Function of Review Score. That is, whether discounts are what most closely causes user sentiment.

- Other factors of the reviews themselves are being considered, as well.



---------------------------------------------
  Where was the Data Obtained?
---------------------------------------------

- SteamApps.json was downloaded directly through the web browser [IsThereAnyDeal](https://isthereanydeal.com/) API call and cleaned.
  - Another, Similarly Structured json file called AppIDDB.json was obtained directly through the web browser

- Steam Sales Data was obtained with the conditional permission Tomáš Fedor, the API Key owner and mainainer of [IsThereAnyDeal](https://isthereanydeal.com/).
  - The condition was that data from IsThereAnyDeal.com must *NOT* be shared publicly, and any requests to view this data will be treated with respect for the API owner    
    and Declined.

- Steam Review Data was obtained from an HTTP Get call from SteamWork's Developer Website.

  How Was the Project Designed?

- NVIDIA CUDA 10.1 Compatibility *STRONGLY RECOMMENDED*!!! *CODE WILL TAKE DAYS TO RUN IF YOU DON'T HAVE CUDA INSTALLED!!!*
- Python (Go In-Depth of all the dependencies required)
